| 0.00 | Anyone who has ever graduated from kindergarten should know the seven foundational data structures of computer science, which include arrays, link lists, hash tables, stacks, cues, graphs, and trees. But if you didn't graduate from kindergarten, here's a quick crash course. A data structure is just a way to organize data in a computer so you can do cred to it efficiently. Create, read, update, and delete it. In a ray is like a row of number cubbies. A linked list is like a treasure map. |
| 37.20 | Q is like a line of kids in the cafeteria, a graph is a spider web, and a tree is, well, like a tree. The programming is all about solving problems. I've got 99 problems, but a data structure ain't what. But for some programmers, data structures do become a problem. In today's video, we'll look at a few unusual situations where these simple data structures were not good enough or smart enough to get the job done. But let's start by talking about the B-tree, not to be confused with a binary tree. One of the most exhilarating things that ever happened in my life was the first time I implemented a binary search. |
| 72.52 | Master row of log-end, but binary search trees have one problem. Each node in the tree can only have two children, which means the depth of the tree grows rapidly, and doesn't scale very well for things like modern hard drives, but with massive amounts of data to search through. To address this problem a long time ago, programmers at Boeing developed the self-balancing tree, or B-tree. Although nowadays you'll mostly find B-plus trees and file systems and databases. At a high level, what makes them special is that each node can have multiple children of sorted keys. |
| 107.52 | 3.8 meters 2 data, so it works kind of like a binary tree, but greatly reduces the disk IO operations by cutting down the height of the tree, which are pretty cool, but there are many other types of trees in nature and in computers, like the Radix tree. Like their billions of IP addresses in the world, but have you ever wondered how computers wrap between them so efficiently to make the internet work. A Radix tree is special because nodes with only one child are merged with their parent, and that makes them highly efficient when finding values with a shared prefix, like an IP address. For example, if I... |

| 179.48 | He's the depth by merging the last child. That's ideal when you have many shared prefixes, but doesn't work so well with big complex strings. Like all the vibe coated slump you're trying to debug in your IDE right now. A rope is yet another type of tree that breaks down strings into manageable chunks. Instead of one continuous strand, you cut it into many smaller manageable segments. Then you tie these segments together using smaller knots that also tell you how long each segment they represent is. This allows tools like text editors to more efficiently model. |
| 213.96 | And that's where Bloomfilters come in. It's a probabilistic data structure that can tell you if an item is definitely not in a set or maybe is in a set. It works by using multiple hash functions to set and check bits in a fixed size array, allowing fast membership tests with possible false positives, but no false negatives. It's like a balancer to club who always knows exactly here to kick out. One of the weirdest things in nature though is the cookie bird. A bird that sneaks into another bird's nest and replaces its eggs with its own. Tricking the host. |
| 248.27 | But also, Cuckoo hash in programming. According to my wife's boyfriend, it's a collision resolution technique, where each key in a hash table has two or more possible positions. And if one spot is taken, the existing key is kicked out like a Cuckoo, and reinserted in an alternate location. The end result is constant time worst case complexity for lookups, which is as fast as you can possibly go when it comes to algorithms. But if you want to optimize your own code with these weird data structures, you need to know about code rabbit, the sponsor of today's video. Did they just release a new video? |
| 283.25 | bugs before you even submit a pull request. Unlike other tools, the extension understands the context of your entire codebase, allowing it to catch more bugs, like all the AI Slob, your favorite coach and tool left behind. It gives you line-by-line comments on all issues, so you can see it reasoning, then it offers simple one-click fixes to help you clean things up quickly. The code rabbit is free to use in the IDE and works seamlessly with VS Code, as well as forks like cursor and windsurf. It download the extension using the link below to try it out. Thanks for watching, and I will see you in the next video. |
