| 0.00 | Yesterday, Google unveiled yet another AI monstrosity upon the world called Alpha Evolve, the latest evolution of its Alpha Coder system that has already crushed the majority of competitive programmers and math elites around the world. But this is not your typical lame, overhyped AI model. |

| 59.11 | State of the Art Solutions, which they're calling a code Super Optimization Agent. In today's video, we'll find out how AlphaEvolve works, and if we finally just reach the runaway AI nightmare that we've all been patiently waiting for, it is May 16th, 2025, and you're watching the code report. Artificial Intelligence just evolved ahead of schedule. Unfortunately, technology like AlphaEvolve is far too powerful for us simple-minded normies, so it won't be open-sourced or even available on an API anytime soon. But despite the fact that AlphaBet stock price has been on the decline. |

| 149.55 | Depp first search. Together they turn out ideas, evaluate them and keep the best ones, then evolve the prompts to continually optimize the final solution. It actually works like natural selection, and it's kind of weird when you realize that we're using evolutionary algorithms to improve deep neural networks, both of which are techniques inspired by nature. And what's also notable about AlphaEvolve is that it's not just churning out Python code. It actually works across massive code bases on any language. But for the 23rd time this year, it looks like programmers just became obsolete. Along with... |
