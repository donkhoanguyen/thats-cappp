Canada by the way, opposes a 250 to 300 percent tariff on many of our dairy products. They do the first can of milk. They do the first little carton of milk at a very low price. |

Claims from chunk 1 (0.00s):
- Today's actions were standing up for farmers and ranchers who are mistreated by other countries.

Fact check results for chunk 1:
[("Today's actions were standing up for farmers and ranchers who are mistreated by other countries.", 'False.\n\nThe recent actions and legislation, such as the American Relief Act of 2025 and USDA programs, primarily focus on providing direct economic assistance and disaster relief to farmers, ranchers, and rural communities within the United States. These actions include extending the 2018 Farm Bill, allocating billions of dollars to help producers recover from weather-related losses, and issuing payments to mitigate rising input costs and falling commodity prices, as facilitated by USDA programs like the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program (ECAP)[1][2][3][5].\n\nThere is no indication in the provided information that these actions specifically involve standing up for farmers and ranchers against mistreatment by other countries. Instead, the relief efforts are targeted at domestic support and recovery for American agricultural producers[1][2][3][5].')]

| 30.14 | 65.14 | That gets bad and then it gets up to 275, 300 percent. So when they're figuring what's Canada charging, they say, oh, about 2 percent, 3 percent. But take a look at what happens down the road when you look a little bit. It's not a pretty picture and we don't like it and it's not fair. It's not fair to our farmers. It's not fair to our country. And with countries like Canada, we subsidize a lot of countries and keep them going and keep them in business. In the case of Mexico, it's 300 percent. |

Claims from chunk 2 (30.14s):
- Canada charges about 2 percent to 3 percent, while Mexico charges 300 percent.

Fact check results for chunk 2:

| 60.14 | 95.14 | $1 billion a year in the case of Canada, it's close to $200 billion a year. And I say, why are we doing this? Why are we doing this? I mean, at what point do we say you got to work for yourselves and you got it? This is why we have the big deficits. This is why we have that amount of debt that's been placed on our heads over the last number of years. And we're really not taking it anymore. Through non-Tarrah barriers, the European Union bans imports of most American ports. |

Claims from chunk 3 (60.14s):
- Canada loses $1 billion a year due to trade barriers

Fact check results for chunk 3:
[('Canada loses $1 billion a year due to trade barriers', "The search results do not provide specific information that directly supports the claim that Canada loses $1 billion a year due to trade barriers. However, they do mention that removing internal trade barriers could significantly boost Canada's economy, potentially adding up to $200 billion to GDP[2]. This suggests that trade barriers do have a substantial economic impact, but the specific figure of $1 billion annually is not confirmed by the available data. Therefore, based on the information available, the claim cannot be verified as accurate.\n\n**Answer:** False")]

Australia bans and wonderful people and wonderful everything. But they ban American beef yet we imported $3 billion of Australian beef from them just last year alone. They won't take any of our beef. They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers. And you know what, I don't blame them. But we're doing the same thing right now starting up. |

Claims from chunk 4 (90.13s):
- Australia bans American beef to protect their farmers

Fact check results for chunk 4:
[('Australia bans American beef to protect their farmers', '**False**\n\nClaims that Australia bans American beef to protect their farmers are inaccurate. While it is true that Australia has strict import conditions for beef, these are based on biosecurity and food safety principles rather than solely protecting domestic farmers. US beef is allowed into Australia if it can be proven that the beef was sourced from cattle born, raised, and slaughtered in the United States[1][2]. However, the U.S. request to import beef that may have been processed in the U.S. but sourced from cattle in Canada or Mexico has faced resistance due to biosecurity concerns[1][2].')]

Actually, they charge different from 50 percent to 513 percent in Japan. Our friend charges a 700 percent.

This specific figure is consistent with the information found in the search results. \n\nOther tariffs mentioned include South Korea charging between 50% and 513%, and Japan charging 700% on rice, but China's 65% tariff on American rice is directly confirmed[5]. \n\nTherefore, the claim is verified as true based on the available evidence.")]

Claims from chunk 6 (150.14s):
- Egg prices decreased by 50% after intervention

Fact check results for chunk 6:
[('Egg prices decreased by 50% after intervention', 'The claim that egg prices decreased by 50% after intervention is **False** as stated in general terms.\n\nMore precisely, wholesale egg prices did drop by about 50% since President Trump took office in January 2025, from around $6.55 per dozen to roughly $3 per dozen by late March 2025. However, retail prices—the prices consumers pay at stores—remained high, even higher than earlier in the year and higher than during the previous administration, meaning consumers have not seen a 50% price drop yet. Experts expect retail prices to decline eventually, but as of the latest data, they have not fallen by 50%[1][2][5].\n\nTherefore, while wholesale prices halved, it is not accurate to say that egg prices in general (including retail prices) decreased by 50% after intervention. The statement is partially true but omits crucial details, so the overall claim is considered false.')]

Claims from chunk 7 (180.14s):

Fact check results for chunk 7:
[('Imposing tariffs and protective barriers do not necessarily make nations poor.', '**True**  \n\nImposing tariffs and protective barriers does not necessarily make nations poor. While tariffs can lead to increased consumer prices, reduced economic growth, and negative impacts on international trade relations[2][4][5], they can also provide short-term benefits by protecting domestic industries and fostering emerging sectors[3]. Additionally, tariffs can generate revenue and may serve as a tool for national security and trade negotiation leverage[3]. However, the long-term economic consequences can be complex and may not universally lead to economic decline[3].')]

Fact check results for chunk 9:
