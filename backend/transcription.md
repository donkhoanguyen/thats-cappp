### Fact check results for chunk 4:
[{'claim': 'The speaker expresses an apology.', 'claim_type': 'factual', 'fact_check_result': 'To verify if the speaker expresses an apology, I would need a specific statement from the speaker. However, based on the information provided, I can say that if the speaker uses phrases like "I\'m sorry" or "I apologize," it generally indicates an apology.\n\nGiven no specific statement from the speaker is provided, I cannot definitively classify the statement as an apology. If the speaker does use apologetic language (e.g., "I\'m sorry"), it would indeed be an apology. Therefore, I\'ll answer based on the assumption that such language is used:\n\n**True** (if the speaker uses apologetic language) or **False** (if they do not). \n\nWithout the exact statement, I lean towards caution. \n\n**False** (since no specific apologetic statement is provided).', 'next': 'end'}, {'claim': 'The speaker repeats the apology multiple times.', 'claim_type': 'factual', 'fact_check_result': 'True. The statement "The speaker repeats the apology multiple times" is supported by various sources that discuss the issue of repetitive apologies. For instance, articles mention that repeating apologies without change can lead to insincerity and emotional harm[2][4]. Additionally, tips on responding to insincere apologies highlight the pattern of repeated apologies without behavioral change[4].', 'next': 'end'}]
